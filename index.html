                            <p>
                                Graduated as a Chemical Engineer, Fábio found his passion in computer science, and 
                                created this page to share every project along the way of becoming a top performer as a software developer.

                        <h2>Get to know me</h2>
                        <p>
                            Born in May 27th, 1995, Fábio lived his whole life in Belo Horizonte/MG, Brazil, where he studied on Marista Dom Silvério, a traditional local school of the city. Right after high school, he decided to start a graduation on Chemical Engineering, on one of the country's most illustrious universities: UFMG (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais).
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            During his graduation, Fábio had the opportunity of escaping the usual "thecnical only" formation and further developing his personal skills, working as a salesman specialist on two separated occasions, both directly in contact with every leading figure and CEO of the companies. Proudly achieved 7 revenue generation records and stablished a new way of dealing with leads. In a start-up growing 100+% each month, was responsible for generating more than R$ 100.000,00 in revenue and held 13% of all company's income during the working period.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            While setting records and becoming a top-performer in the field,completed his graduation as a Chemical Engineer and decided to learn how to code to automate regular tasks but, in the end, fell in love with everything tech-related and could not bear the idea of not working with that. Decided, then, to drop out of sales and is now attending a 1-year full-stack course, to better understand and work on the field.

                        <p>
                            This website was created in order to share Fábio's most relavant projects and ideas, while also listing relavant stuff about the field.
